#The application developed will help the user to keep track of recipes he or she has
cooked,

*When a user comes to the home page, there should be a navigation bar. The
navigation bar should be in a separate functional component and imported to app.js(or
main) file.

*In the home page, all the recipes the user has entered should be shown as a table or
cards. There should be 2 buttons to delete and edit for each recipe.

*There should be a “Add a recipe” button for the user to add a new recipe. You can use
a modal or a separate page to get input from the user. There should be recipe name,
ingredients, description as form inputs and a button to save these values.

*When a user clicks a recipe in the home page, it should be redirected to a separate
page and display all the details of that recipe on that page.

*When a user clicks the delete button, an Alert should be displayed asking “Are you
sure you want to delete the recipe?”. If the user clicks “OK”, it should be deleted from
the database and the web page should be automatically refreshed.

*If a user clicks the “Edit” button, the website should be redirected to a new page with
the recipe values and those values should be displayed on the form for the user to edit
the recipe.


*ID, Recipe name, Ingredients, Description should be used as entities for the database.
